# 🎬 ViFlix

## 🧾 Description
ViFlix is a movie streaming website backend built with ASP.NET Core and Web API. The project allows admins to manage movies, genres, and download links, and it's structured to support future user-side features like watchlists and reviews.

This is a portfolio project created entirely by me, aiming to simulate the backend of a real-world movie platform with scalable and modular design.
